# IrrationalNumberCalculator
A Node JS program built to calculate the decimal expansions of common irrational number
To run, install NodeJS as well as the prompt-sync module
Each number uses a different infinite series expression to calculate the number.
Some are more well known than others, such as Leibniz formula for π.
Others are more obscure, such as the infinite series expression for Φ, that [Brian Roselle discovered in this paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320548874_Development_of_an_Infinite_Series_Representation_for_Phi_the_Golden_Mean_or_Golden_Ratio)

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how quickly different algorithms and series converge to their exact value
For example, Φ gets approximated very quickly, as Roselles series begins with a rational value of 13/8.
